	//Search in Rotated Array: Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown
	//number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was
	//originally sorted in increasing order,

	// Instead of two or more pass of binary search the result can be found in one pass of binary search. The binary search needs to be modified to perform the search. The idea is to create a recursive function that takes l and r as range in input and the key.
	//
	//1) Find middle point mid = (l + h)/2
	//2) If key is present at middle point, return mid.
	//3) Else If arr[l..mid] is sorted
	//    a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[l]
	//       to arr[mid], recur for arr[l..mid].
	//    b) Else recur for arr[mid+1..h]
	//4) Else (arr[mid+1..h] must be sorted)
	//    a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[mid+1]
	//       to arr[h], recur for arr[mid+1..h].
	//    b) Else recur for arr[l..mid]

	// Returns index of key in arr[l..h]
	// if key is present, otherwise returns -1


	//Complexity Analysis:
	//
	//Time Complexity: O(log n).
	//Binary Search requires log n comparisons to find the element. So time complexity is O(log n).
	//Space Complexity: O(1).
	//As no extra space is required.

	//How to handle duplicates?
	//It doesnâ€™t look possible to search in O(Logn) time in all cases when duplicates are allowed. For example consider searching 0 in {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2} and {2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}.
	//It doesnâ€™t look possible to decide whether to recur for the left half or right half by doing a constant number of comparisons at the middle.
