	// how you can use a single array to implement three stacks

	//Approach 1
	// Divide the array of size n into k equal slots.Size of each stack will be n/k
	//First stack: arr[0] to arr[n/k-1]
	//Second stack: arr[n/k] to arr[2n/k-1]

	//Cons// space will not be utilized efficently

//n=15 k=3 n/k = 15/3 =5
